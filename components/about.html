            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in 2024, JODO Winery & Distillery was born from a love for crafting exceptional beverages that bring people together. Our vision is to provide a unique tasting experience, where guests can explore the finest wines, whiskies, and spirits in a warm and inviting atmosphere.
              <br />
              What started as a small vineyard has since expanded to include a full range of premium beverages. From our signature wines to artisanal whiskies and hand-crafted spirits, every bottle is a testament to our dedication to craftsmanship and quality.
